# Python Terminal Mario

## Introduction

A game similar to popular game Mario

This game has been written using _almost_ Vanilla Python. Important to note that the game has been tested on **ONLY** Linux-based OSs, and _may not_ work on Windows.

- Each player/enemy is a derived class of the `Character` class.
- The `board` has its own class and and captures all objects placed on it.

## Running the program

- Go into the respective directory
	- `./game.py`

- To fire `f`
- To quit, press `q`
